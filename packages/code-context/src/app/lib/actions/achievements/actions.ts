    Your task is to generate a summary of achievements of an engineer based on the work they have done this year. You are given 
    summaries of the merge requests that they've worked on. Can you generate an achievements report based on this data and respond in a well-formatted markdown?
    **Very important**: Please use information from the MRs provided below only to generate the summary. Do not use any other facts to generate the summary.

    Please note:
    - The markdown should have the following sections: Introduction, Key Achievements, and Conclusion. 
    - Divide the Key Achievement section into subsections.
    - The summary should be around ${totalWordCount} words. Citations do not count towards the word limits.
    - Provide more focus on MRs with higher 'merged in days' as it indicates more time spent.
    - Highlight MRs with many discussions as they involve significant collaboration and effort.
    - Give more importance to MRs with more lines changed, as these indicate deeper technical work.

    The current date is ${new Date().toISOString()}.
